# Angular Drag and Drop
**A Native ( without jquery ) Drag and Drop directive for AngularJS using HTML5 Drag and Drop**

---

##ui-draggable(expression)

Directive in module ang-drag-drop (since 1.0.5 - old module name ngDragDrop)

The ui-draggable attribute tells Angular that the element is draggable. ui-draggable takes an expression as the attribute value. The expression should evaluate to either true or false. You can toggle the draggability of an element using this expression.

###Additional Attributes

####_**on-drop-success**_(function)

The `on-drop-failure` attribute takes a function. We can consider this to be an on-drop-failure handler function. This can be useful if you need to do some post processing after the dragged element is dropped unsuccessfully on any drop site.

**NOTE**: This callback function is only called when the drop fails.

##ui-on-drop(expression)

Directive in module ang-drag-drop (since 1.0.5 - old module name ngDragDrop)

The `ui-on-drop` attribute tells Angular that the element is a drop site. `ui-on-drop` takes a function as the attribute value. The function will be called when a valid dragged element is dropped in that location. A valid dragged element is one which has the same channel as the drop location.

**NOTE** : This callback function is only called when the drop succeeds.
The `ui-on-drop` callback can request additional parameters. The data that is dragged is available to the callback as $data and its channel as `$channel`. Apart from this the drop event is exposed as `$event`.

####_**drop-validate**_(function)
